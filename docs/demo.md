# The playtest demo

*2026-10-30 · follows [Phase 4h](phase-4h.md)*

A build of the game for playtesters, as it stands at the end of Phase 4: the Prelude run (Movement I) with everything the Loom has opened by then. It's published as a private link (a claude.ai Artifact) that its owner can share. Nothing is collected from players.

## Starting

The first screen asks how to start:
- **Start fresh** is a new Weaver: the real first hours, every station dark until it opens, each with its first-contact intro. This is the build's main test: does each system make sense when it arrives?
- **Veteran** is a Weaver some hours in, so the later systems can be tried at once:
  - Rank 12, with the Astrolabe's points left to spend;
  - Starlight for the Atelier, and one variant (Purge) owned;
  - the Luminary mastered (its title earned, Chorale for sale) and the Martyr on her way;
  - each hero at Bond rank 4 (their first talents);
  - two relics enshrined, with materials to craft.
  The stations' intros still play on first visit.

Settings → *Start the demo over* comes back to this choice. Progress stays in the browser that played it (and only for the session where the browser blocks storage).

## Building it

```sh
npm run build:demo        # VITE_DEMO=1, relative paths, no source maps → dist-demo/
```

`DEMO` (src/app/demo.ts) is false in every other build, so the normal game never shows the choice. The demo's starts are tested in tests/demo.test.ts.

## Publishing

`dist-demo/index.html` is the page, and its `assets/` (107 files, 4.4 MB) are published beside it as the artifact's own files. The page loads nothing from anywhere else.
- **Where it is:** [Aetherweaver](https://claude.ai/artifact/WQmazTSTrGDW3SpS4CQ9Uv), a private claude.ai artifact (slug `ee2a9adf-b9b9-4612-abe0-a64652bfb45b`). Only its owner sees it until they share it from its page on claude.ai.
- **To update it,** rebuild and republish the folder to the same artifact (its slug and current version), so the link stays the same.
- **Checked before publishing:** the build was served under a content policy like the host's (its own files only, no eval), and both starts were clicked through. Fresh and veteran, the Title, the Loom with its welcome, Prep: no console errors, page errors or failed requests. For the Thread dial's update, a fresh start went on into the Training Grounds, and the dial turned from Mend to Empower on a right-click, again with no errors.

## For testers

- **New since the first build:** the Thread dial over the Weaver bar, and a glyph over the hero you've threaded, show at a glance whether you're Mending or Empowering ([docs/thread-dial.md](thread-dial.md)).
- **Play on a computer** with a keyboard and mouse. The Title, the Loom and the Atelier also take a gamepad; fights don't yet.
- **Sound starts with your first click** (browsers require it).
- **Nothing is collected.** There's no feedback form or telemetry in this build; tell its owner what you found.
